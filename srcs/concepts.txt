Ft_Arena Concepts: (T1)

A) Child/Parent Class
1a) creating class
2a) class inheritance

B) Storing data into classes
1b) data given through user input
2b) data is stored and used for main rpoject

C) Creating a simple game simulation via a simple container
1c) managing while loops and conditions
2c) creating hero/villains/etc. from class and data
3c) allow the characters to fight eachother

Requirements:
Students are expected to create a parent class that all their
child will inherit. They are than expected to make at least three
children that will have their own special attack. There needs to
be a menu where users can set the stats for each of the three children,
and than once at least two of the three children stats are set, they can
press play and the two children will fight to the death.
All input/output will be done through terminal which is handled by a
game container that will allow the children to fight.

Project Detail:
Students will be creating three characters of their choosing to battle
it out in an arena 1v1 style! Create a simple game interface where the
users can input the character stats, and allow them to pick two characters
to begin fighting in the game. The game will output each characters health
each round when the fight begins, and students will be expected to describe
all fighting events outputted to the terminal.
Students will also be responsible for writing the fight sequence in a simple
game class container.

Bonus:
Addition heroes, additional special attack, additional stats or mechanism, sounds, etc.
